### Development

Built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deployed through Netlify.

To develop locally:
```bash
npm i # install locally
npm run build # download latest data & build latest version
cd website
npm run dev
```

To build the static export:
```
npm run build
```

The static export then is in `website/dist`.
