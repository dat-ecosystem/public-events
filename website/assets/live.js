In a digital age libraries need to structure knowledge of images, video, code and datasets etc.  These come from many authors and on a daily volume hard for humans to keep pace with.  Inspired by projects like https://www.researchobject.org/  how would such thinking work on peer to peer infrastructure?    We will demonstrate working code of a network library ( https://youtu.be/N-Ak9mvmZZM )  that creates a set of 'smart' reference contracts that describe datatypes, computations, visualizations and modules that allow for the creation of network experiments.",

Please feel very invited to join this discussion, both with ideas and questions on how the ecosystem could develop.",
