SUMMARY:Hypercores mapped to IPLD by Jim Pick
DESCRIPTION:The Hypercore data structure is built on top of a Merkle tree\
 , and can be represented as a DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph. In this presen
 tation\, we will describe the data structure\, and show how to construct a
  representation using the IPLD (Interplanetary Linked Data) library that i
 s used by IPFS and Filecoin (also works standalone). Finally\, we will sho
 w how to implement a storage provider that retrieves hypercore data from a
 n IPLD-based datastore.
