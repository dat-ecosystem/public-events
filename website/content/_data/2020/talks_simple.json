    "description": "Structured documentation have found in different ways a place in the javascript ecosystem. Be it jsdoc, flow-type or typescript definition files: structured documentation is helpful in the exploration of a project (particularly options) to people outside of the project. Both martin and sam have been working on hyper* definition files and in Hyperswarm we have a discussion open on how to add TypeScript definition files [#55](https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm/issues/55#issuecomment-607318923) that haven't found their way in the project yet.\r\n\r\nFirst we will have a short ~20min presentation on important things  we learned about writing definitions files, followed by a 1h workshop to add declaration to a project and in a follow-up step we want to discuss how we can bring this practically to the whole system.",

Such indexing excludes the visibility of other non-traditional outputs such as data sets and figures, and at times peer-reviewed articles from select fields and indigenous communities. Academic status quo practices act as gatekeeper of knowledge by ranking research outputs as well as deciding which forms of knowledge become valid. \r\n\r\nIntersectional approach will be used to refine an idea for a community owned platform to capture and search traditional as well as non-traditional research outputs with a persistent digital identifier.",

How does one navigate the complex environments and entrenched power structures of the Web? What is the cost of the labour asked of an individual creator and the impact on their well-being?\r\n\r\nAs an initiative of the Distributed Press project, and inspired by a surrealist parlour game, we will assemble the words and images generated during our workshop to compose a work of collective authorship to express our aspirations for the future web.",
