# Dat Conference 2020


Hello, and welcome to the first virtual Dat Conference.

Here's a few notes how the conference will work and how you can be part of it.

The conference runs for two days, on Thursday and Friday. The full and always up-to-date schedule is available on our [website](https://events.dat.foundation/2020/schedule/).

We prepared two means to interact with everyone:

1. Our `Main Room` of the conference for interacting with the presenters/conducters for each event. 
2. You can join our `Discord Chat` room to hang out and for informal conversations.

_Please note that our [Code of Conduct](https://events.dat.foundation/2020/coc/) applies._

### Main Room

The Conference runs in a single, virtual audio-video room. This is where the presenters will talk, and also where you can join for Q&A and other interaction. You can join the room using the following invite link: [https://conf.collocall.de/b/dat-zwe-ubk](https://conf.collocall.de/b/dat-zwe-ubk).

This room will also be available as Youtube live stream to watch along. For that reason, be aware that everything in the room is recorded! The live stream is available [directly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQi9KQ9guWw&list=PL7sG5SCUNyeYx8wnfMOUpsh7rM_g0w_cu&index=1).

In the room, there's a chat and shared notes. Feel invited to use these together with others to take notes and ask questions!

If you join the room, your microphone will be muted. You can usually unmute yourself, but please do so only in the Q&A or discussion parts of the sessions. Please respect how the presenter(s) want to run their session. We may need to restrict this ability if this is a problem.

If the presenter does a Q&A part, first write in the chat that you want to talk, and wait for the presenter to call you out. Then, unmute your microphone and talk along. If you want to share your screen (e.g. in a workshop session) please ask in the chat so moderators can unlock screen sharing.


### Discord Chat

For casual conversations and general chatter we have a conference lobby chat room on Discord. Use the following invite link to join the discussion: https://discord.gg/yXtTSE6

We are using discord because it is also the prefered chat for the hypercore-protocol. For anything event-related, feel free to use the `#datconf` room.

For those unfamiliar with discord: It allows you to create groups with other participants for breakout conversations in which you can also use the your microphones.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the chat or raise an issue on [our github repo](https://github.com/datproject/public-events/issues/new).
